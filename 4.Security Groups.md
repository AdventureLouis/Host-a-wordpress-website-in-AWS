### Security Groups
![Projects_Achitecture](https://github.com/AdventureLouis/Host-a-wordpress-website-in-AWS/assets/161846069/55d1d736-910d-4019-8fb6-06b8d06d6911)

The security group is a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic on EC2 instances
Try to look at the architectural diagram above,we notice that VPC is our private section in the cloud and all AWS services that will be used for this project is embeded inside the VPC,
Now the security which is also one of the resources in the architecture will help to control how traffic flow through every other resources.
we will be creating resource groups for  Webservers,Databases,Application load Balancers,EFS etc.
Now in other illustrate how the security groups will combine to control traffic,by observing the architecture above,when traffic comes from the internet the traffic must first go through the Application load balancer before it can access the webservers and as such the webservers can only accept traffic from the application load balancer and the Database servers are only going to accept traffic from the webservers and the EFS can only accept traffic from the webservers.

![DB_SG3](https://github.com/AdventureLouis/Host-a-wordpress-website-in-AWS/assets/161846069/e8470328-0561-438c-a203-ead66c920c73)

The next security group that we will create now is Database Security Group,so click create security group again,give a name to the security group,under Description can use same name as
name of the security group,under VPC select the VPC we created earlier,under Inbound rules,click add rules,under type select MySQL/Aurora,under Source Select Webservers Security Group that we created previously

### Elastic File System Security Group(EFS)
![EFS_SG1](https://github.com/AdventureLouis/Host-a-wordpress-website-in-AWS/assets/161846069/017bd777-4aba-4e73-aece-2a90fa2aafe4)

One last step to do is to route traffic to the EFS itself,and to do this,check the box next to the EFS security group and click edit inbound rules,under Type select NFS again and under source this time select NFS security group we created previously.This can be seen in above diagrams
