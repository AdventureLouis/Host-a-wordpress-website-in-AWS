The security group is a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic on EC2 instances
Try to look at the architectural diagram above,we notice that VPC is our private section in the cloud and all AWS services that will be used for this project is embeded inside the VPC,
Now the security which is also one of the resources in the architecture will help to control how traffic flow through every other resources.
we will be creating resource groups for  Webservers,Databases,Application load Balancers,EFS etc.
Now in other illustrate how the security groups will combine to control traffic,by observing the architecture above,when traffic comes from the internet the traffic must first go through the Application load balancer before it can access the webservers and as such the webservers can only accept traffic from the application load balancer and the Database servers are only going to accept traffic from the webservers and the EFS can only accept traffic from the webservers.

Now lets begin the process of creating security groups in the AWS management console,while in management console,ensure that your region is selected my own region is Singapore
on the left part select security group click create security group at the top left corner AS shown above
