By using the above architectural diagram, we will build a three-tiered VPC, also note that for this project 2 different availability zones will be used, ðŸ‘‡ I will illustrate the three tiers
<br>
(a)**Tier 1** - 2 public subnets created in separate availability zones, and these subnets will hold resources like NAT gateway and the load balancer
<br>
(b)**Tier 2** - 2 private subnets in separate  availability zones and these subnets will hold resources like webservers and auto-scaling groups
<br>
(c) **Tier 3**- 2 private subnets in separate  availability zones, and these subnets will hold resources like Database
