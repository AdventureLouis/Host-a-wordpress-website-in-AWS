### Creating the VPC
VPC Stands for private virtual cloud,every resources that will be created in this projects will be inside the VPC
<br>
Login to AWS management console,and while in your management console,at the top right corner,select your region,in this case my region is Singapore and this is becauese during  creation of this project 
the HK region is not enabled on my account
<br>
So while you are in aws management console,on the search  bar type VPC and this can be shown in diagram below

<br>
Once the VPC page is open on the left corner select My VPCs and click create VPC,Select VPC only,on IPV4 CIDR Block,type 10.0.0.0/16,on tenancy tab,select default and click create VPC
this can be illustrated in two diagrams below

After creating the VPC,another important step is to enable the DNS Hostnames,this will help to ensure that after compoleting all configurations you can access your site with DNS hostnames
To achieve this,check the box next to the VPC and select the drop down on actions menu,the select Edit vpc settings,next check the box next to Enable DNS Hostname

![VPC5](https://github.com/AdventureLouis/Host-a-wordpress-website-in-AWS/assets/161846069/1364d718-2617-40a2-b65e-9b0926323347)

### Create internet Gateway
Still on the VPC page,scroll down on the left part and select Internet gateway,select create internet gateway on the top left part,give a name to your internet gateway and select create internet gateway at the bottom

If we observe below we will notice that the newly created internet gateway is deatched

Now to attache the internet gateway,check the box next to internet gateway,click on actions tab at the top and on the drop down select attach to VPC,the next box that appears select the VPC that was created earlier,it is also important to note that only one internet gateway cam be attached to a VPC

As can be seen ðŸ‘‡ we have attached the internet gateway to the VPC,now instances on the VPC will have access to the internet
