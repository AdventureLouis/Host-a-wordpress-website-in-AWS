### Creating the VPC
VPC Stands for private virtual cloud,every resources that will be created in this projects will be inside the VPC
<br>
Login to AWS management console,and while in your management console,at the top right corner,select your region,in this case my region is Singapore and this is becauese during  creation of this project 
the HK region is not enabled on my account
<br>
So while you are in aws management console,on the search  bar type VPC and this can be shown in diagram below
![VPC](https://github.com/AdventureLouis/Host-a-wordpress-website-in-AWS/assets/161846069/b944b405-59fe-4c23-b8eb-f5d76bda5877)
<br>
Once the VPC page is open on the left corner select My VPCs and click create VPC,Select VPC only,on IPV4 CIDR Block,type 10.0.0.0/16,on tenancy tab,select default and click create VPC
this can be illustrated in two diagrams below
![VPC1](https://github.com/AdventureLouis/Host-a-wordpress-website-in-AWS/assets/161846069/37297fe5-5c8d-46e0-bdec-61b142217d47)

![VPC2](https://github.com/AdventureLouis/Host-a-wordpress-website-in-AWS/assets/161846069/84e6634d-a2a1-49df-96eb-cade8c2eb8c7)
<br>
After creating the VPC,another important step is to enable the DNS Hostnames,this will help to ensure that after compoleting all configurations you can access your site with DNS hostnames
To achieve this,check the box next to the VPC and select the drop down on actions menu,the select Edit vpc settings,next check the box next to Enable DNS Hostname

![VPC4](https://github.com/AdventureLouis/Host-a-wordpress-website-in-AWS/assets/161846069/81adabb1-23b8-4f47-b90e-99432437ebd4)

![VPC5](https://github.com/AdventureLouis/Host-a-wordpress-website-in-AWS/assets/161846069/1364d718-2617-40a2-b65e-9b0926323347)

### Create internet Gateway
Still on the VPC page,scroll down on the left part and select Internet gateway,select create internet gateway on the top left part,give a name to your internet gateway and select create internet gateway at the bottom
<br>
![igw2](https://github.com/AdventureLouis/Host-a-wordpress-website-in-AWS/assets/161846069/e4406199-7ee4-401a-8a92-a64746286609)

![IGW1](https://github.com/AdventureLouis/Host-a-wordpress-website-in-AWS/assets/161846069/4627c6c7-bbdb-4194-9b5f-d5f539b728d7)
If we observe below we will notice that the newly created internet gateway is deatched
![IGW3](https://github.com/AdventureLouis/Host-a-wordpress-website-in-AWS/assets/161846069/9172b8e8-0ef7-42ef-9c71-eca480178c4f)
<BR>
Now to attache the internet gateway,check the box next to internet gateway,click on actions tab at the top and on the drop down select attach to VPC,the next box that appears select the VPC that was created earlier,it is also important to note that only one internet gateway cam be attached to a VPC

![Screenshot 2024-05-29 at 4 00 06â€¯PM](https://github.com/AdventureLouis/Host-a-wordpress-website-in-AWS/assets/161846069/a9004a55-5cf2-4d95-b26b-42a0f2603cc4)

![IGW5](https://github.com/AdventureLouis/Host-a-wordpress-website-in-AWS/assets/161846069/1ed250ca-aa38-4cdd-8059-5b5722ecafbc)
As can be seen ðŸ‘‡ we have attached the internet gateway to the VPC,now instances on the VPC will have access to the internet
![IGW6](https://github.com/AdventureLouis/Host-a-wordpress-website-in-AWS/assets/161846069/cf627904-ebe7-4ae8-bd4d-578e82d3f819)


### Create Public Subnets
Still under VPC service,on the left part select subnets and at the top left select create subnet,on VPC id select your VPC,give the subnet a name,on the availaibility zone select Asia pacific(Singapore)/ap-southeast-1a on IPv4 subnet CIDR block type 10.0.0.0/24 and select create subnet at the bottom righ corner,all this is illustrated in 2 diagrams ðŸ‘‡ 

![subnet1](https://github.com/AdventureLouis/Host-a-wordpress-website-in-AWS/assets/161846069/f5d80519-6628-42f9-8ba2-329151d22ee4)

![subnet2](https://github.com/AdventureLouis/Host-a-wordpress-website-in-AWS/assets/161846069/796014e1-f1c7-4956-8935-d9d68d0cfe6e)

<br>
I will create a second public subnet in a second availaibility zone,give it a name,now select the second availabilty zone Asia pacific(Singapore)/ap-southeast-1b,on IPv4 subnet CIDR block type 10.0.1.0/24

![subnet3](https://github.com/AdventureLouis/Host-a-wordpress-website-in-AWS/assets/161846069/9c465b80-ec3f-41dc-b84c-13cac667fc9f)
<br>
Now we can see below the two public subnets and they are in two different availability zones

![subnet4](https://github.com/AdventureLouis/Host-a-wordpress-website-in-AWS/assets/161846069/1c47c71d-f5dd-4ecb-8cbb-f418ad9d53d5)

![subnet5](https://github.com/AdventureLouis/Host-a-wordpress-website-in-AWS/assets/161846069/eb706ceb-7e21-4580-b07b-65e8864943e1)
<br>
Now in the next step,I will modify the IP Settings of the public subnets that I just created,to do this check the box of the first public subnet and select Actions menu at the top right corner and on the drop down select Edit subnet settings,under Auto-assign IP settings check the box next to Enable auto-assign public IPv4 address and click save at the bottom right,and this will be done for the two public subnets as shown ðŸ‘‡ 

![subnet6](https://github.com/AdventureLouis/Host-a-wordpress-website-in-AWS/assets/161846069/225e51f0-6300-4c0c-95c8-2497a38647a1)

![subnet7](https://github.com/AdventureLouis/Host-a-wordpress-website-in-AWS/assets/161846069/7ec9453c-fb07-4bbd-9e54-942f0d9041e1)

![subnet8](https://github.com/AdventureLouis/Host-a-wordpress-website-in-AWS/assets/161846069/af0d7f22-192c-4f48-9c60-4a3474621715)

![subnet9](https://github.com/AdventureLouis/Host-a-wordpress-website-in-AWS/assets/161846069/04c1a665-4a74-4f7c-a394-c187ce7da705)

### Route Table creation
In the following steps I will create table,create the public routes and associate the public subnets we previously created to the route tables.
So while still on the VPC service on the left part,select route tables and at the top right corner click create route tables and give the route table a name and at the bottom click create route table
![route1](https://github.com/AdventureLouis/Host-a-wordpress-website-in-AWS/assets/161846069/e8408492-e5d8-4ac4-8792-9567be104c1a)

![route2](https://github.com/AdventureLouis/Host-a-wordpress-website-in-AWS/assets/161846069/fc788ece-b1fc-4aa5-8372-b838be4ab50a)
Next we will add a route to the public route table,check the box next to the public route we just created,click on route tab at the bottom and click edit routes,
now a new dialog box will appaear,click add route,under destination select  0.0.0.0/0 and this symbol implies route anywhere,under target select internet gateway and select the internet gateway that was previously created.
![route3](https://github.com/AdventureLouis/Host-a-wordpress-website-in-AWS/assets/161846069/7a4ed108-8256-4d1d-b605-bf94c219c4b2)
Next lets associate the public route table to our two public subnet so that that the public subnet can have access to the internet,so to do this,check the box next to route table and at the bottom click on the subnet Association menu and click edit subnet associations and finally check the box next two the two public subnets and click save,all these are illustrated in the 3 diagrams ðŸ‘‡
