### Creating the VPC
VPC Stands for private virtual cloud,every resources that will be created in this projects will be inside the VPC
<br>
Login to AWS management console,and while in your management console,at the top right corner,select your region,in this case my region is Singapore and this is becauese during  creation of this project 
the HK region is not enabled on my account
<br>
So while you are in aws management console,on the search  bar type VPC and this can be shown in diagram below
