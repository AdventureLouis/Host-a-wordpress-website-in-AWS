<br>
Before I explain the importance and use of Application balancer first I will like to refresh your mind on how our architecture is designed as seen in above diagram. 

Our architecture is designed in such a way that a user from outside or a user from the internet cannot directly access or interact with instances in our private subnet such ec2 and RDS 
and this is security best practice.Now in order to achieve this goal we will utilize an Application load balancer in AWS.
<br>
An Application balancer(ALB) is a load balancing service that is managed my AWS,It is designed to distribute traffic  accross multiple targets such as Amazon ec2 instances,containers,IP addresses,
or lambda functions
<br>
Before creatin an Application load balancer,we first need to create two ec2 instances in the private app subnets that we earliear created.Recall that previously,we created the setup server instance and had the wordpress
files saved in EFS,now we create instances in the private subnet,attach them to EFS and delete the setup instance in the public subnet.

### Creating Private Instances

While in AWS management console,on the search bar type ec2 and start creating your new instance  Give it a name and choose the "Amazon Linux 2 AMI (HVM)" instance, this is important for compatibility with WordPress. as seen above

Make sure that your "Instance type" is in the free tier mode, like the "t2.micro" that is chosen by default. Then, select the "newEC2key" key pair that we created.

<br>

For the "Network settings",choose the custom VPC that we created,for subnet choose My subnet1|App Tier1(an app private subnet in AZ1),for "Firewall (security groups)",select existing security group
and choose webserver security group.
