Now we will be creating an RDS in AWS,while in the management console,ensure you are in the right region,click on services,click Databases at the buttom and select RDS
Now the Amazon RDS page is on display as seen above.

Before creating the RDS,we first need to create subnet groups,so on the left select subnet groups,now select create DB Subnet Group at the top left,give a name to the subnet group,
under description give same name as subnet group,under VPC select the demo VPC that was earlier created,under Availability zone,select the two availability zones,in my case its ap-southeast-1a and ap-southeast-1b,under subnet,in the first availability zone select 10.0.4.0/24 and in second availabilty zone select select 10.0.5.0/24 and the reason we specifically selected these two 1pv4 CIDR is because they are the private subnets created for the  Database Tier during creating of the VPC.
<br>
The diagrams for creating subnet groups is shown above
<br>
Now that we have successfully created subnet group we can now go ahaed to create the RDS
