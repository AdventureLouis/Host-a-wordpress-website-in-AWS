Before creating the RDS,we first need to create subnet groups,so on the left select subnet groups,now select create DB Subnet Group at the top left,give a name to the subnet group,
under description give same name as subnet group,under VPC select the demo VPC that was earlier created,under Availability zone,select the two availability zones,in my case its ap-southeast-1a and ap-southeast-1b,under subnet,in the first availability zone select 10.0.4.0/24 and in second availabilty zone select select 10.0.5.0/24 and the reason we specifically selected these two 1pv4 CIDR is because they are the private subnets created for the  Database Tier during creating of the VPC.
<br>
The diagrams for creating subnet groups is shown above
<br>
Now that we have successfully created subnet group we can now go ahaed to create the RDS
<br>
Click create Database,under Choose a database creation method leave at Standard create,under Engine options choose Mysql,Engine Version choose MySQL 5.7.44,under Template choose free tier,DB instance identifier choose a name,under Credential settings choose a master username,
<br>
Under credentials management choose self management and specify your password.
<br>
under Instance configuration,leave it as default to db.t3.micro and also leave the storage as default
<br>
under Connectivity,leave the Compute resource as default,under Virtual private cloud (VPC) select our VPC we created earlier
<br>
under DB subnet group,ensure to select the subnet group we just created,under Public access choose NO

<br>
Under Availability zone select any of your choice in my case I will choose the first Availability zone
