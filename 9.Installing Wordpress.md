### How to Install Wordpress
After ssh into the ec2 as we did previously,we will now through the ec2 instance install wordpress and move the files to EFS
<br>
The purpose of moving the file to EFS is because EFS has high availability,so our data will be stored across multiple availability zones
<br>
Now lets begin the wordpress installation,type the below commands
```bash
sudo su
yum update -y
mkdir -p /var/www/html
sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,noresvport <yourEfsMountHere>:/ /var/www/html
```
<br>
Now in last code above replace "yourEfsMountHere" with your EFS mount below ðŸ‘‡ I will show you how to get your EFS mount information
<br
### Create HTML Directory and mount EFS to it
<br>

To get your EFS mount information,in your AWS management console in your region,on the search bar type EFS,and click on your EFS to open it as shown below

<br>
next click on attach at the top right corner as shown below

<br>
sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,noresvport <yourEfsMountHere>:/ /var/www/html
<br>
Under Using the NFS client,you will see your EFS mount information just,now all you need do is copy the EFS info up till backslash(/) symbol,then space /var/www/html,as illustrated
in code above
<br>
![Installing_wordpress4](https://github.com/AdventureLouis/Host-a-wordpress-website-in-AWS/assets/161846069/454aa852-d46b-419c-8cb1-7c33f19243cf)

Next is to copy the last mount code and paste it as last line on your terminal as shown above
<br>
To test if you have successfully mounted the EFS type "df -h" and should be able to see your mount EFS on the last line
<br>
*sudo su
yum update -y
mkdir -p /var/www/html
sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,noresvport <yourEfsMountHere>:/ /var/www/html*
<br>
Now I think its important I explain above codes which I executed previously so that you have a feel of what is going on
<br>
*sudo su*-->This command will elevate the users permissions to administrative permission thereby making the user a root user
<br>
*yum update -y*-->This commsnd updates the packages in the ec2 instance to latest versions,the flag y command(-y) authomatically answers yes to any prompt during the update process
<br>
*mkdir -p /var/www/html*--> This command will help to create a directory named var/www/html,the flag p(-p) indicates the creation of parent directory inside the directory,and  seems we will be installing apache server,the directory var/www/html will help to save the index files
<br>
*sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,noresvport fs-096a3d3f272ac3543.efs.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com:/ /var/www/html*-->so basically this command mounts the EFS files system to the directory (/var/www/html) using the NFS protocol(that is files or directories can be shared over NFS network)
<br>
*nfsvers*=4.1--> This command specifies the NFS version 4.1
<br>
*rsize*=1048576--> This command sets the read buffer size to 1048576 bytes
<br>
*wsize*=1048576--> This command sets the write buffer to 1048576 bytes
<br>
*hard*--> This command sets the mount to "hard" so that it can authomatically retry indefinately incase of server or network issues
<br>
*timeo=600*-->this command sets the timeout for the NFS to 600seconds which is 10mints
<br>
*retrans=2*--> This command sets the number of retransmission to 2 which means the client will have to retry failed operations twice
<br>
*noresvport*-->This command allows the NFS client to use any available port for communication
<br>
*fs-096a3d3f272ac3543.efs.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com:/*--> This command specifies the DNS name of the filesytem and symbol :/ signifies the root directory to mount
<br>
It is important to note that in order to install the wordpress we will need the LAMP packages.
<br>
LAMP is acronym for Linux(operating system),Apache(Webserver),Mysql(Database) and PHP 7.4(Server-side scripting language)
<br>
### 2. Install Apache Server 
The Apache is an open source http webserver for delivering web content,another name for Apache is httpd
<br>
Now its time to install the apache server and below commands will be used
<br>

```bash
sudo yum install -y httpd httpd-tools mod_ssl

sudo systemctl status httpd 

sudo systemctl enable httpd

sudo systemctl start httpd
```
sudo yum install -y httpd httpd-tools mod_ssl --> This command installs the Apache server package and (httpd-tools) installs neccessary tools,(mod_ssl)ensures secure connection 
<br>
sudo systemctl status httpd --> This command is used to check the status of services in this its checking status for httpd
<br>
sudo systemctl enable httpd--> This command is used to enable the httpd to start authomatically at boot time
<br>
sudo systemctl start httpd--> This command is used to start the httpd service immediately.It initiates the Apache http server allowing it to handle incoming requests
<br>

<br>
After running all commands above,next run the command sudo systemctl status httpd to know if the httpd server is active as shown above
<br>

### 3. Install PHP 7.4
<br>
Now run below commands to install PHP 7.4
<br>

```bash
sudo amazon-linux-extras enable php7.4

The extensions listed in the command include CGI (php-cgi), cURL (php-curl), Multibyte String (php-mbstring), GD Graphics Library (php-gd), MySQL Native Driver (php-mysqlnd), Gettext (php-gettext), JSON (php-json), XML (php-xml), FastCGI Process Manager (php-fpm), Internationalization (php-intl), and ZIP (php-zip)
<br>

### 4 Install MySQL 5.7
Now runn below commands

```bash
sudo rpm -Uvh https://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql57-community-release-el7-11.noarch.rpm
sudo rpm --import https://repo.mysql.com/RPM-GPG-KEY-mysql-2022

*sudo systemctl enable mysqld*--> This command enables the Mysql service to start authomatically whenever it boots.
*sudo systemctl start mysqld*-->This command help to start mysql service
<br>

###5. Set Permissions
```bash
sudo usermod -a -G apache ec2-user
sudo chown -R ec2-user:apache /var/www
sudo chmod 2775 /var/www && find /var/www -type d -exec sudo chmod 2775 {} \;
sudo find /var/www -type f -exec sudo chmod 0664 {} \;
sudo chown apache:apache -R /var/www/html
```
<br>

*sudo usermod -a -G apache ec2-user*--> This command will help to add the ec2-user to Apache group,this will enable the sc2-user to able to access files and directories owned by the Apache group
<br>
*sudo chown -R ec2-user:apache /var/www* -->This command changes the ownership of /var/www and its content to the ec2-user,thereby ensuring that the ec2-user have neccessary permissions to manage the files.The /var/www is a default root directory for storing web content in open source web servers like Apache
<br>
*sudo chmod 2775 /var/www && find /var/www -type d -exec sudo chmod 2775 {} \;* --> This command sets the directory permissions of the root directory /var/www to 2775. The 2 at the begining ensures that the new files and directories inherit the group ownership and the 775 permissions grant read,write, and execute permissions to the owner and group
<br>
*sudo find /var/www -type f -exec sudo chmod 0664 {} \;* --> The command set the permissions of /var/www and its subdirectories to 0664.The
6 at the begining grants read and write permissions to the owner and group and grants read permissions to others.
<br>
*sudo chown apache:apache -R /var/www/html* --> This command changes the ownership and content of /var/www/html directory to Apache,this will ensure that the webserver now runnning as the Apache user has the neccessary permisions to read and serve web content.

### Download wordpress files
<br>

```bash
wget https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
tar -xzf latest.tar.gz
cp -r wordpress/* /var/www/html/
```
<br>
![Installing_wordpress9](https://github.com/AdventureLouis/Host-a-wordpress-website-in-AWS/assets/161846069/b93f9b61-27e1-4a9e-adee-0c870d7b6a6e)

*wget https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz* --> wget is short form for world wide web get,this command  uses the wget tool to downlaod the latest version of wordpress in a compressed format(compressed tarball) from the official wordpress website.
<br>
*tar -xzf latest.tar.gz* --> This command decompressess the comprised file
<br>
*cp -r wordpress/* /var/www/html/* --> This command recursively (-r) copy all files from the extracted wordpress directory to the root directory of the webserver  (/var/www/html/)
<br>
Now after running all above commands,on terminal type ls and you will see wordpress folder and latest.tar.gz
<br>

### 7.Create the wp-config.php file
<br>

``` bash
cp /var/www/html/wp-config-sample.php /var/www/html/wp-config.php

```
<br>
 The above command is used to make a duplicate of of the wordpress sample configuration file(wp-config-sample.php) and rename it to wp-config.php.The purpose for creating a copy is to have the original sample file as a backup
 <br>
 To see the newly duplicated file,type the command ls wordpress/
