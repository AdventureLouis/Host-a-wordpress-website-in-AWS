### How to Install Wordpress
After ssh into the ec2 as we did previously,we will now through the ec2 instance install wordpress and move the files to EFS
<br>
The purpose of moving the file to EFS is because EFS has high availability,so our data will be stored across multiple availability zones
<br>
Now lets begin the wordpress installation,type the below commands
sudo su
yum update -y
mkdir -p /var/www/html
sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,noresvport <yourEfsMountHere>:/ /var/www/html
<br>
Now in last code above replace "<yourEfsMountHere>" with your EFS mount below ðŸ‘‡ I will show you how to get your EFS mount information
<br
### Create HTML Directory and mount EFS to it
<br>

To get your EFS mount information,in your AWS management console in your region,on the search bar type EFS,and click on your EFS to open it as shown below

<br>
next click on attach at the top right corner as shown below

<br>
sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,noresvport <yourEfsMountHere>:/ /var/www/html
<br>
Under Using the NFS client,you will see your EFS mount information just,now all you need do is copy the EFS info up till backslash(/) symbol,then space /var/www/html,as illustrated
in code above
<br>

Next is to copy the last mount code and paste it as last line on your terminal as shown above
<br>
To test if you have successfully mounted the EFS type "df -h" and should be able to see your mount EFS on the last line
<br>
*sudo su
yum update -y
mkdir -p /var/www/html
sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,noresvport <yourEfsMountHere>:/ /var/www/html*
<br>
Now I think its important I explain above codes which I executed previously so that you have a feel of what is going on
<br>
*sudo su*-->This command will elevate the users permissions to administrative permission thereby making the user a root user
<br>
*yum update -y*-->This commsnd updates the packages in the ec2 instance to latest versions,the flag y command(-y) authomatically answers yes to any prompt during the update process
<br>
*mkdir -p /var/www/html*--> This command will help to create a directory named var/www/html,the flag p(-p) indicates the creation of parent directory inside the directory,and  seems we will be installing apache server,the directory var/www/html will help to save the index files
<br>
*sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,noresvport fs-096a3d3f272ac3543.efs.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com:/ /var/www/html*-->so basically this command mounts the EFS files system to the directory (/var/www/html) using the NFS protocol(that is files or directories can be shared over NFS network)
<br>
*nfsvers*=4.1--> this command specifies the NFS version 4.1
<br>
*rsize*=1048576--> This command sets the read buffer size to 1048576 bytes
<br>
*wsize*=1048576--> This command sets the write buffer to 1048576 bytes
<br>
*hard*--> This command sets the mount to "hard" so that it can authomatically retry indefinately incase of server or network issues
<br>
*timeo=600*-->this command sets the timeout for the NFS to 600seconds which is 10mints
<br>
*retrans=2*--> This command sets the number of retransmission to 2 which means the client will have to retry failed operations twice
<br>
*noresvport*-->This command allows the NFS client to use any available port for communication
<br>
*fs-096a3d3f272ac3543.efs.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com:/*--> This command specifies the DNS name of the filesytem and symbol :/ signifies the root directory to mount
<br>
### 2. Install Apache Server 
<br>
Now its time to install the apache server and below commands will be used
<br>
*sudo yum install -y httpd httpd-tools mod_ssl*--> This command
*sudo systemctl status httpd*
*sudo systemctl enable httpd*
*sudo systemctl start httpd*
